# CMOS Imaging Sensors: Digital Cameras for Astrophotography

> A presentation held at the Timișoara Polytechnic University in 21 of April,
> 2026

This repository hosts the contents of the presentation and its complimentary
flake and devenv configuration to replicate the tools and configuration used for
the presentation itself.

> You can have a sense (with no videos, transitions, pauses nor interactivity)

> [exported pdf version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/de-abreu/sensors-presentation/refs/heads/main/embedded-systems-presentation.pdf).

## How to run

### Using [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html)

```bash
nix run github:de-abreu/sensors-presentation
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> This way all data will be stored in your nix-store and later garbage collected
> automatically (if garbage collection is setup).

### Using [devenv](https://devenv.sh/)

```bash
git clone github:de-abreu/sensors-presentation \
&& cd sensors-presentation \
&& devenv shell -- run
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> To enter a development environment instead of just running the presentation,
> drop the `-- run` when using `devenv shell`.
